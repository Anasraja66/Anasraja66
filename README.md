## 💼 What I Do

I build **intelligent, scalable web applications** and **autonomous AI pipelines** with a sharp focus on:

- **AI agents & automation** workflows (e.g. via n8n)
- **AI‑driven integrations** using public and custom AI APIs
- **Backend development** with Django, REST/GraphQL APIs, and microservices
- Modern frontend frameworks: **Next.js** & **React**
- **DevOps & deployment**: CI/CD, Docker, container orchestration, and cloud hosting

## 🚀 Experience Highlights

- Designed and built full‑stack web applications combining **Django backends** with **Next.js/React frontends**.
- Delivered **AI agent systems** and **automation workflows** using n8n, orchestrating agents that process, decide and act autonomously.
- Created clean **AI‑API integrations**, including retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) setups and custom chatbot APIs.
- Implemented DevOps pipelines for production deployments: containerization, automated CI/CD, and cloud service orchestration.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- **AI Agent Automator:** A system of autonomous agents managing task flows (e.g. CRM triage, notifications, data enrichment).
- **Backend API Platform:** Django‑based backend powering a Next.js frontend, with role‑based access, user management, and real‑time features.
- **Workflow Automation via n8n:** Multi-step pipelines triggering AI tasks, data transformations, external service integrations.
- **Full‑stack web apps:** Responsive React/Next.js UI backed by Django APIs, deployed with scalable DevOps practices.
